# Blanket Answer:
    # 1: d, h, g, e
    # 2: No, i is not independent of k, because K has a path to a have a path to i. J is irrelevant?
    # 3: 

# Blanket questions:
    # what does it mean when i and j in a network is independent? 
      # Isn't a node A dependent on all nodes that has a path to A?
    
# Hidden Markov questions:
    # What is X and Y? X = Internal state, happy/sad. Y = observasion, wathcing, crying...
    # What does "the probability of X0" / p(X0) mean? Initial state, 
    # What is theta: p(Xt|Xt-1) / transition matrix how to calculate it? 
    # What is phi:  p(Yt|Xt) / observation matrix



    ## Questions: ##
      
      ## About Structure:
        # Is the array of internal state an array of probailities of being happy or a bool array? {h, s}
        # Is probState supposed to be a vector of {chance of happy, chance of sad} or just a number? veector.
      
      ## About Algorithm:
        # How do I calulate / pick observation probability(P(Yt|Xt)) (in the simplified expression) for an activity wihtout knowing the internal state?
        # Where does transition table come into the picture?
        # I think inbetween every action, the transition table should be used somehow.
        # After the transition table, I think the observation table will be used somehow. Drawing.
        # The starting state for X is the inital probability of being happy, what is the corresponding action for that X value?

      ## General:
        # Was there an exercise with a similar implimentation? Ex5 only had PCA and Neural Networks.
        # NO HISTORY!




    ## New Questions: ##
        # - What is quesiton 3 asking?
        # - The input and output state is set of probabilites {h, s}, then how can question 3 define that we are happy in a timestep as a boolean.
        #   Should I treat this boolean representation as {1, 0}?
        # - mat.dot() or broadcast?? Shape problems. 2x2 * 2x1 = 2x2, Why?
